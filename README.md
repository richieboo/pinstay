A Chrome extension that prevents pinned tabs from accidentally navigating away from their original domain.

## Features ✨

- **🔒 Domain Locking**: Prevents pinned tabs from leaving their original domain
- **💡 Smart Notifications**: Shows helpful popup messages when navigation is blocked
- **📱 User-Friendly**: Clean, non-intrusive notifications with custom styling
- **⚡ Lightweight**: Minimal performance impact on your browsing experience
- **🛡️ Persistent Protection**: Works reliably even after browser sits idle overnight

## Security & Privacy 🔐

**100% Open Source & Auditable**

PinStay's complete source code is available for review in this repository. You can verify exactly what the extension does.

**Zero Data Collection**

- ❌ No tracking
- ❌ No analytics
- ❌ No data sent to external servers
- ✅ All processing happens locally in your browser

**About the "Not Trusted by Enhanced Safe Browsing" Warning**

Chrome may show this warning because PinStay requires broad permissions (`<all_urls>`) to function. Here's why this is necessary and safe:

- **Why needed**: PinStay must monitor navigation on ANY website you might pin (Gmail, GitHub, localhost:3000, etc.). We can't predict which domains you'll use.
- **What we don't do**: PinStay does not read, collect, or transmit your page content or browsing data.
- **Transparency**: Our entire codebase is open source. Review `background.js` to see exactly what happens.
- **Legitimacy**: This warning appears for many legitimate extensions that need cross-site permissions. It often fades as the extension gains trust through usage.

**Permissions Explained**

- `tabs` - Track which tabs are pinned
- `webNavigation` - Detect and redirect navigation attempts
- `scripting` - Show local notifications on the page
- `storage` - Remember pinned tabs between sessions
- `<all_urls>` - Monitor navigation across all domains (necessary for any-site pinning)

## Installation 🚀

### From Chrome Web Store (Recommended)

## How to Use 📖

### Basic Usage

1. **Pin a tab** by clicking the pin icon in the tab bar, or right-click the tab and select "Pin tab"
2. PinStay automatically locks the tab to its current domain
3. Try to navigate away - PinStay will prevent it and show a notification
4. **Unpin the tab** to remove protection (click the pin icon again or right-click → "Unpin")

### What Happens When Navigation Is Blocked

### Popup Notifications
